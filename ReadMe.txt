My work

first page:My Photo, information and Interests about  me.

Second page: One calculation and the respective video about that

Third page: If you are about to contact me then you can email me.

I have used html,bootstrap and css files to create this page
In this I added calculation function to get position of the object with respect to inverse y-axis
I used jquery and java script to print the objects

Suppose you're at (a, b) and the object is at (c, d). 
Then the relative position of the object to you is (x, y) = (c - a, d - b).

So: say I'm at (10,10) and the object is at (10,5) -
that would result in 90 degrees (as positive Y is down, negative Y is up) (10,10) vs (10,15) would be 270 degrees.
